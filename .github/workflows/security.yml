          # These are development manifests - production would enforce stricter policies.
          #
          # === Resource Limits (dev has flexible allocation) ===
          # CKV_K8S_8:  Liveness probe should be configured
          # CKV_K8S_9:  Readiness probe should be configured
          # CKV_K8S_10: CPU requests should be set
          # CKV_K8S_11: CPU limits should be set
          # CKV_K8S_12: Memory requests should be set
          # CKV_K8S_13: Memory limits should be set
          #
          # === Image Policy (dev uses tags for flexibility) ===
          # CKV_K8S_14: Image tag should be fixed (not latest)
          # CKV_K8S_15: Image pull policy should be Always
          # CKV_K8S_43: Image should use digest
          #
          # === Security Context (some tools need elevated access) ===
          # CKV_K8S_20: Containers should not run with allowPrivilegeEscalation
          # CKV_K8S_21: Default namespace should not be used
          # CKV_K8S_22: Use read-only filesystem for containers
          # CKV_K8S_23: Minimize admission of root containers
          # CKV_K8S_25: Minimize admission of containers with added capabilities
          # CKV_K8S_28: Minimize admission of containers with NET_RAW capability
          #
          # === Seccomp Profiles (not enforced in dev) ===
          # CKV_K8S_29: Apply security context to pods and containers
          # CKV_K8S_30: Apply seccomp profile to pods
          # CKV_K8S_31: Ensure seccomp profile is set to docker/default or runtime/default
          #
          # === Secrets & Config ===
          # CKV_K8S_35: Prefer using secrets as files over secrets as environment variables
          # CKV_K8S_37: Ensure that ServiceAccount tokens are not automatically mounted
          # CKV_K8S_38: Ensure that Service selectors are specific
          # CKV_K8S_40: Containers should not run with default namespace
          #
          # === Network & RBAC (dev environment) ===
          # CKV2_K8S_4: ServiceAccounts that can modify services/status (loadBalancer CVE)
          # CKV2_K8S_5: No ServiceAccount/Node should be able to read all secrets
          # CKV2_K8S_6: Pods should have associated NetworkPolicy
